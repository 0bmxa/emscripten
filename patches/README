This directory contains a useful mercurial patch queue.

To use it, link .hg/patches to it (it isn't possible to add .hg/patches itself directly, hence the need for this), using something like

  ln -s patches .hg/patches

After doing so, |hg qpush| sauer, and then running |python tests/runner.py| will run only sauer, using v8, and without optimizations or relooping.

Note to patch queue maintainer: You need to manually copy from .hg/patches into this directory, after |qrefresh|ing the patch.
