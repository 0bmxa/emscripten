This folder contains the musl version of libc at `/musl`.  The upstream version can be found at http://www.musl-libc.org/

Some changes have been made to the version that was taken from upstream, including:
* A large number of emscripten-specific changes (from before this readme existed)
* Backporting an operator-precedence warning fix from 6e76e1540fc58a418494bf5eb832b556f9c5763e in the upstream version
